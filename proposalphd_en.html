<!-- l. 69 --><p class='noindent'>Public space has become hot discussion in city planning for the past 100 years. The increasing population
cause there is a demand for public space. This increasing was depicted by the existence of the residence’s mass
construction, dense vehicle in the road, and the increasing of business and economy sector. This increasing
population stress every each individual in experience their daily life. People then are looking for a restorative
place together to escape from hustle and bustle of daily routines and get rid of the stress caused by ambience
of the city.
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='indent'>   Public space is a place that accommodate all kind of personal or group activities in searching of
amusement and other positive things (<a href='#Xsadat2012'>Hajmirsadeghi et al.</a>, <a href='#Xsadat2012'>2012</a>). <a href='#Xsadat2012'>Hajmirsadeghi et al.</a> (<a href='#Xsadat2012'>2012</a>) argue that
park, square, waterfront and street are a form from public space. Based on its function, public space can
become a place for recreation, work, business, social culture and heritage.
</p><!-- l. 74 --><p class='indent'>   People begin to considering public space when they look for a place that is accessible. This space become
accommodation for people’s daily activities. For example street which people cross everyday. Square that is
used for routine exercise. The existence acitivities in public space contribute to city’s life quality and reflect to
adjacent people’s condition.
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>   <a href='#Xahmadi2009'>Ahmadi et al.</a> (<a href='#Xahmadi2009'>2009</a>) state that public space own various characters. Those characters explain about what
is in the physical and social environment (<a href='#Xdougherty2006'>Dougherty</a>, <a href='#Xdougherty2006'>2006</a>). In addition, <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and Martokusumo</a> (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>)
state that physical element, acitivity and ambience are the character’s maker. Furthermore, few of researcher
have found characteristic is a request of fulfillment and reflection of the circumstance of nearby
people.
</p><!-- l. 78 --><p class='indent'>   Parepare have plenty public space with each own characteristic. For example, Andi Makassau Park,
Parepare beach, Syariah Park, Tonrangeng waterfront, and etc. Now, all of the attention is in the waterfront
public space which is the focus of the research.
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
</p><!-- l. 80 --><p class='indent'>   Solo karajae Festival represent the heart of Parepare waterfront is still beating. A thousand people come
together to tonrangeng to watch a variety of shows in a week. This public space, according to <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and
Martokusumo</a> (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>), explain that the identity of the city through its physical element. It is because people
enjoy the city by sightseing, feeling, and understanding the information such as paths, landmarks, trees, sea,
and other elements.
</p><!-- l. 82 --><p class='indent'>   Sometimes the relationship between public space and city are very closed. People mark that
they have been in the Parepare city by taking photos in the BJ Habibie public space. Public
space, its name, its characteristic, have become the city identity. Therefore, space elements had
better be well designed in order to show the right characters and perceive by users (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and
Martokusumo</a>, <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>).
</p><!-- l. 84 --><p class='indent'>   A number of public space stimulate Parepare to carry ideas of The City of BJ. Habibie’s Love. BJ. Habibie
was a third president of Indonesia who was born in Parepare. His Contribution toward Indonesia has become
inspiration to Parepare city. This ideas should be the new identity of Parepare. A identity of place, based
on Kevin Lynch, is a foundation to recognize something to be a discrete things (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and
Martokusumo</a>, <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>). According to <i>Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate</i>, Identity is the distinctive character or
personality of a things or individual. Similarly, according to <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and Martokusumo</a> (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>), the city
identity can be formed through characteristic
</p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='indent'>   the same, according to <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and Martokusumo</a> (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>), city’s identity can be formed through
characters which its inside. It can through physical form or physical appearance. However, it can go through
the image ability concept which consist of identity, structure, and meaning (<span class='rm-lmbx-10x-x-109'>?</span>).
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='indent'>   <a href='#Xhartanti2014'>Hartanti and Martokusumo</a> (<a href='#Xhartanti2014'>2014</a>) state that identity can become a requirement of good environment. She
added that form identity of city will strengthening its difference, building an event or specific mark
and supporting few specific motive. For example Salo Karajae festive which become unique and
special event on the seaside. That event has been ongoing for the last years and succeed. Many
different attraction was conducted such as video mapping on the sea, beautify boat, and others
activity.
</p><!-- l. 92 --><p class='indent'>   The research about public space character has been broadly conducted, however little has
been known conducted in the seaside area. The appearance of difference characteristic because of
its border close to the sea is an extra value toward public space. <a href='#Xhussein2014'>Hussein</a> (<a href='#Xhussein2014'>2014</a>) explain that
the succesfull of the city attract people to the seaside depend on public space there. Therefore,
this research will explore the characteristic of public space in shaping the identity of Parepare
city.

<!-- l. 97 --><p class='noindent'>A successful city identity came from a strong and free image (Oktay,2002). Most of it is characterized by
public space. Meanwhile, the most prominent public space is currently in the coastal area. This region is an
amazing and flexible place (Hussein,2014). According to Oktay(2002), in the seeking for city identity in the
changing city context, finding public spaces should include broad notions such as people’s activities,
experiences, and relationships with the public space itself. Coastal areas of the sea do have extraordinary
potential. Parepare as a city which bordering of the sea takes advantage of this opportunity to
build a number of seacoast public spaces. This development is considered drastic, where within
the span of a period of political office, more than one public space is produced and reformed.
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
The development first took place in 2011. It renovated the Senggol Beach public space which
is now called Parepare Beach. This is followed by the construction of other public spaces from
scratch. In addition, development also spread to the city center. Unlike other cities, Parepare
departs with an undeveloped identity. Many cities have had a strong identity for a long time. As an
example, the city of Bogor, a domestic city, had a city identity related to plants (Hartanti and
Martokusumo,2014). In addition, there is a city of north Cyprus, a foreign city, had the identity of the old city
(Oktay,2002).Oktay(2002) explained that identity consists of a number of characteristics or elements of public
space that can be identified. The identity of the city of Parepare which is promoted recently is the city
of love. That triggered the construction of a public space called BJ Habibie and Ainun. One of
the most prominent is the BJ Habibie monument which islocated in the Andi Makkasau park.
Two of them are located on the sea coast, namely the multipurpose building and the BJ Habibie
hospital which is close to the Tonrangeng riverside. Even though this development implied BJ
Habibie’s “city of love” with a number of naming or public statues in public spaces, it did not mean
that public spaces can automatically form the expected urban identity. The characteristics of
each public space played an important role in shaping urban identity (Oktay,2002).Lynch(1984)
described the character of public space by paying attention to the elements that are arranged
and their relationship to each other and forms a distinguishing character, which indicated an
identity (Hartanti and Martokusumo,2014). Hartanti and Martokusumo(2014) emphasized that
differentiating is the most important process in recognizing a place identity. This related to physical form,
activity and atmosphere. Based on the previous description, this research studied the character of
public space on the sea coast. So this research would answer a number of research questions as
follows:

<h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>III   </span> <a id='x1-30003'></a>Objective of the research</h3>
<p><a id='Q1-1-6'></a></p>
<!-- l. 109 --><p class='noindent'>This study aims to study the characteristics of seacoast public spaces. These characters are explained in the
context of spatial elements, people’s activities, experiences, and relationships with public spaces. So that this
research can explain the identity of the city of Parepare. According to Oktay(2002), identity is able to build
individual interest in a place and stay for a long time. This ability is a sign of a successful coastal public space
(Hussein,2014). The researcher hoped that the results of this study can be used to identify the identity of the
city of Parepare. That way, the development of parepare cities can refer to identity so that it gets
stronger.

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>IV   </span> <a id='x1-40004'></a>Research method</h3>
<p><a id='Q1-1-8'></a></p>
<!-- l. 117 --><p class='noindent'>This study aims to find out the differentiating characters between spaces in forming city identities. In terms of
achieving these goals, a research approach is needed. The research approach is a process or research plan
including steps, detailed methods in the collection, analysis, meaning of the findings (Creswell and Poth,2016).
This research approach is qualitative and quantitative (mixed-method). A qualitative approach produces an
overall picture of a phenomenon through direct understanding and observation of the phenomenon in the
research object accompanied by data sources (Creswell and Poth,2016). This phenomenon is in the form of
characteristics of public spaces that form the identity of public spaces. According toGroats and Wang(2013),
qualitative research emphasizes the inductive process, asCreswell and PothExplain this by giving
open-ended questions. The question is in the form of what identity the individual feels in the
parepare city and how does that affect the individual.Creswell and Poth(2016) explained that
this question can develop along with the researcher’s understanding of the problems in the field
(Creswell and Poth,2016). The quantitative approach is used to examine certain populations or
samples. Data collection based on research variables. Then administering a questionnaire survey to
find the most dominant characteristics for users in seacoast public spaces. So that this research
can find out the identity of seacoast public space through its forming characteristics for better
design.

<p><a id='Q1-1-10'></a></p>
<!-- l. 121 --><p class='noindent'>The rapid development of a city can lead to the failure of the formation of a city’s identity. More than that,
you can also remove and change existing characters (Hartanti and Martokusumo,2012). People can recognize a
city as something different if they get the essence of the city’s identity. According toOktay(2002), a strong
identity in a city will attract and support the people in a city. Public space, accordingHartanti and
Martokusumo(2014), explains the identity of a city through its physical characteristics. Through this research,
the characteristics of a number of public spaces on the coast that form the city’s identity can
be identified. So that urban planning can be based on these characteristics and follow known
identities.
